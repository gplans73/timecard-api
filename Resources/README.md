How to rebuild a fresh project:
1) In Xcode, File → New → Project → iOS App (SwiftUI). Name it anything.
2) Quit the boilerplate files Xcode makes (ContentView.swift, <AppName>App.swift).
3) Drag ALL .swift files from this folder into the new project (copy items if needed) and ensure your app target is checked.
4) Add an image named 'logo' to Assets.xcassets if you want the logo to show.
5) Select your Team in Signing and run.

Modules used: SwiftUI, Combine, PDFKit, MessageUI (Mail compose works only if Mail is configured on the device).
